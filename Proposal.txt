# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
Sword Demo (may change in future)
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO:
We will do a top down RPG with only 1 demo fighting boss scene (turn base)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
A functioning game with NPC interaction and boss fighting(turn base), a little bit with items interaction
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
Josh O'Halloran. TUO43905
Josh Trimble. TUP31478
Khanh Nguyen. TUP82660

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
A working game with enough functioning feature (fight, map) and ofcourse its running fine
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
adding more NPC, more fighting option (flee, ultimate, charging attacks)
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
adding NPC dialogue, more interaction with items
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
As of right now we are sourcing open domain, and public domain, assets for our game. 
This will help us save time in our game development. We are also developing our combat system, 
currently deciding between turn based combat (pokemon style) or interactive combat (zelda). 
Working with pygame and calling our assets to the program is our current mission to tackle.
